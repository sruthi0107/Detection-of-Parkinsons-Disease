# Detection of Parkinson's Disease Using Spiral/Wave Test
This project employs the spiral/wave test for detection of parkinson's disease where the user is required to draw a spiral or a wave, save an image of it in their system and 
upload it on the website. The project uses the random forest classifier model combined with histogram of gradients to predict the presence of parkinson's in the individual.

This project was inspired by [Adrian Rosebrock](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/04/29/detecting-parkinsons-disease-with-opencv-computer-vision-and-the-spiral-wave-test) and the dataset was obtained from Adrian's website but was originally curated by Adriano de Oliveira Andrade and Joao Paulo Folado from the NIATS of Federal University of UberlaÌ‚ndia.

## Running the files:
1) Clone all the files into your local machine
2) From your command prompt/terminal, cd into the appropriate folder- `cd <location of the index.py file>`
3) Run the following command- `python index.py`
4) Copy and paste the link generated in your browser- `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

#### NOTE: Ensure that you have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) installed in your system. Also ensure that you have run the following commands in your terminal-
1. `pip install sklearn`
2. `pip install numpy`
3. `pip install opencv-python`
4. `pip install Pillow`

#### This project was created by myself in collaboration with [Prasad Adhiyaman](https://github.com/Prasad-adhi/Detection-of-Parkinsons-Disease)
